                        Nepalâ€™s rugged topography and recurring heavy
                        monsoon rainfall patterns lead to a number of
                        geological and hydro-meteorological hazards every
                        year. Landslide is one of the most occurring and
                        impactful among these natural hazards.

            development activities.
